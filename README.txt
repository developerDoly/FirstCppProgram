This is a library of fundamental C++ concepts
that was useful to me when I began C++
and I hope is useful as a reference in case I or you
need some quick examples.

I expect to come back to every example and refresh/upgrade and and all details as I learn more.

Please email me if you have questions or suggestions for improvements or if you catch an error.

Constant improvements is the name of the game, my friends.
